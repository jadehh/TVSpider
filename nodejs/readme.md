## WIP

We are currently working on embedding a Node.js runtime environment into the app and have made progress with the initial coding. This is a simple Node.js project, and the build artifacts of this project can be utilized within CatVodApp.

Due to the differences across platforms, there are certain functionalities within the Node.js runtime that not available, including but not limited to 
 - `wasm`
 - `jit` on macos & ios



Dev `npm run dev`

Build `npm run build`
